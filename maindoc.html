          <h1>First Steps</h1>
          <p class="whitecontent">Welcome to EestiTalk.</p>
          <p class ="whitecontent">In order to start learning this language, we'd like to have a quick word about this learning process.</p>
          
          <p class ="whitecontent">We are going to learn the language via phrase mining, this means that you'll learn the usual structure of the phrases being used daily so you can get a hang of the syntax of the language, and then we'd focus on grammar a little bit.</p>

          <p class ="whitecontent">In the future I plan to include sound files of the words being said in the exercises spoken by a native, the plan is to keep the website lightweight in order to whip it out in any emergency case (low load times and high accessibility to the content that we require)</p>

          <p class ="whitecontent">Pay attention to the words being posted in the whiteboard, you'll have to hover it in order to discover the translation, this method is basically the same as flashcards.</p>

          <p class ="whitecontent">The studying plan should be the next</p>

          <div class="doublecolumn">
            <div class="lessoncontent">
              <p>Read the lesson and its contents</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="lessoncontent secondarybkg">
              <p>Write down the words in the whiteboard in a notebook</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lessoncontent">
              <p>Read the lesson and its contents</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="lessoncontent secondarybkg">
              <p>Play around with the words, write them out (in paper) and see if you've got the right verbose (Google Translator it's not the best program to check syntax but will do good at this level)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lessoncontent">
              <p>Read the lesson and its contents</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="lessoncontent secondarybkg">
              <p>Play around with the words, write them out (in paper) and see if you've got the right verbose (Google Translator it's not the best program to check syntax but will do good at this level)</p>
            </div>
    
            </div>

          <p class ="whitecontent">And as a plus, I highly recommend putting the words that you've learned in a deck similar such as Anki, you can download a deck made by a different person but the progress is severely diminished if you didn't make it yourself, and try to at least review it once a day.</p>
          <p class ="whitecontent">I'll include a tutorial on how to do that in this website.</p>
          <p class ="whitecontent">And without delay, we encourage you to go ahead and have your first lesson!</p>
